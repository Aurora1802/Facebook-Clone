                <ol>
                    <li>When we place <b>img</b> inside a <b>div</b> (block) element, if we don't define the <b>display: flex</b> property for the <b>div</b> container => the <b>img</b> by default will follow the arrangement of the block (div).
                    </li>

                    <li><b>margin: bottom</b> can be used to add more space between the items in the <b>flex container.</b>
                    </li>

                    <li>The <b>unset</b> CSS keyword resets a property to its inherited value if the property naturally inherits from its parent, and to its initial value if not.
                    </li>

                    <li>anchor (or link) is an inline element.</li>

                    <li>Because <b>a</b> elements lie inside imp-links-block element, if we don't define the display property for its child, then the childs will have its layout-block, which mean they will display in vertical direction.
                    </li>
                
                    <li><b>flex:</b> 1 0 auto => shorthand for <b>flex-grow, flex-shrink, flex-basis</b>.<b> flex-basis</b> sets the lenghts of the flex items. If a class has the property of flex as <b>flex: 1;</b> => each flex items inside this class will distributed available space equally among them. This ensures that all child elements expand to fill the container horizontally. More info:

                    <li><b>display: inline-block</b> => Create a specific block for each element under its section to maintain the structure of each element.</li>
                    <li><b>display: inline-flex</b> => Does not reserve any specific space in normal form.
